### About ###

Tests are written in Java
I used Selenide framework for test automation (easier and more readable, also faster than Selenium).


### To run tests, simply: ###

1) Right-click ```regression-test-suites.xml``` and click Run
2) To see the report simply run a command in Terminal ```allure serve build/allure-results```
