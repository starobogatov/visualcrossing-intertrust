### About ###

Tests are written in Java
Instead of Selenium I used Selenide (easier and more readable, also faster).


### To run tests, simply: ###

1) Right-click ```weather-history-test-suite.xml``` and click Run
2) To see the report simply run a command in Terminal ```allure serve build/allure-results```
